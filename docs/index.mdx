**MetaMCP** is a MCP proxy that lets you dynamically aggregate MCP servers into a unified MCP server, and apply middlewares. MetaMCP itself is a MCP server so it can be easily plugged into **ANY** MCP clients.

Generally developers can use MetaMCP as **infrastructure** to host dynamically composed MCP servers through a unified endpoint, and build agents on top of it.
